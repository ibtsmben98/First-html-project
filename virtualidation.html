    <h1>Virtualization</h1>

  <p>In computing,<b> virtualization</b>  refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something,<br>
     this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.Levels of Virtualization</p>
<hr>
  <h1>levels of Virtualization</h1>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</b><br>
<p> Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.<br>
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.</p>
</li>

  <li><b>Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</b><br>
    <p>
    In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S.,
     application suites, networking systems, etc.<br>
   </p>
     <ul>
       <li>In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer<br> (HAL) level this can take too much time.
       </li>
       <li>So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system <br>between Virtual machines along with the hardware. </li>
     </ul>
